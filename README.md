# Notice
This project is currently being rewritten.

You can view the old C# version of my GameBoy emulator in the `old` folder, or by viewing previous commits.

## Why?
I wanted to rewrite this project in C for two main reasons:

- Improve my C skills
- Make this portable enough for me to be able to put this on a microcontroller.

At the current state, it is not ready to be used on a microcontroller, and definitely not to be used to play
games for fun. This is for now just a WIP "PoC" for a portable emulator. (I'm sure it's been done, but I wanna try doing this myself.)
